# torch is a dependency of whisper, specify if you need CPU/GPU version explicitly
# For CPU only:
# torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# For CUDA (adjust cuXXX version based on your CUDA install):
# torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# If unsure, pip will often pick a suitable version, but explicit is safer.
